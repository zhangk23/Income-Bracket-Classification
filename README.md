# Income-Bracket-Classification


The goal of this assignment is to train, validate, and tune multiple classifiers that can predict, given a set of observations about a person, which income bracket they fall into. Data used in this assignment is census data from a previous year that contains information about people across the United States.

Note: 

1. The two csv files used ( income-training.csv , income-testing.csv ) should be in the same directory as this IPython script.
2. Some sections in this script requries longer computation time, your patience is very much appriciated!
